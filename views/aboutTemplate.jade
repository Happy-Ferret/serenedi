      | What is Serenedi?
    p
      | <br/>Serenedi is a new and easy way to help you find fun and exiting events around your location without any hassle.  <br/><br/>Tell Serenedi what you are interested in, and Serenedi will do its best to show you fun and exiting events that meet your interests on a map for you to see!  <br/><br/> However, please do note that Serenedi is currently at a Beta stage, which means you are more than welcome to use Serenedi but there is still a lot of work to be done on Serenedi. So if you have any problems, bugs or any suggestions, please contact us so we can work on it. 
      | <br/>Serenedi is an evolving project and we would like to evolve Serenedi to people's needs and wants. <br/><br/>If you have any opinions or suggestions, or simply want to say hi, we would love to hear from you.<br/><br/><br/>
