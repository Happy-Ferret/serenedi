What's happening?

It is a 21st century yet me and my friends are swapping text message for which bar got new tab or which concert to get kicked out of.  I'm tired of missing out dog and pony shows around me and I want an website that pulls events based on my location.   

There has to be a better way.  

Maybe [serenedi](http://serenedi.co) is not the solution but it is a twisted soul's phathetic attempt at it.


 * Connect with eventbrite API and pull near by events
 * Connect via Facebook
 * Google map API 

Running
-------
Pull the code then run following

	`npm install`
	`npm start`

Hooray...
